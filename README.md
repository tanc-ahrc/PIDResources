# PID Resources
This site is now live in an initial form for consultation and feedback. This resource describes the different aspects of developing persistent identifiers (PIDs) in the context of Heritage Collections. It is aimed at senior technical stakeholders within galleries, libraries, archives and museums to assist with developing requirements and advocacy for new services.

This resource will be revised in 2021 and maintained until the conclusion of the Towards a National Collection programme in 2025. Comments and discussions are welcome, as are additional examples. Please raise an issue via Github if you want to comment or use the orange feedback button at the bottom of each page.
