They can also refer to canonical metadata, e.g. a creator of an object.<\/p>   <p>Examples of PIDs include archival resource keys (ARKs), persistent URIs and digital object identifiers (DOIs). Generally a persistent identifier can be presented as an actionable link which can be used to access the resource or metadata about the resource.<\/p><\/div>  <figure class=\"figure\"><img src=\"graphics\/pid resource intro example.jpg\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block\" alt=\"Icon illustrating example of a PID embedded in a webpage.\"></figure><h4>Why use PIDs?<\/h4>  <p>Persistent identifiers have a number of potential benefits. They allow you to reliably link to your collection around the web and in publications. They also make it easier to track the use of your resources where they are cited elsewhere.<\/p>  [##]<p>Following consultation in May 2021, it is now available in a revised version.

		"content": "<p>To make sure PIDs stay active and resolvable steps have to be taken to ensure they are maintained. The options of signing up to an initiative requiring persistence, adopting an internal policy or utilising a third party service, are described in more detail.<\/p>  <h3>Local persistence<\/h3>  <p>Many heritage organisations are long-lived and have a public remit to preserve their collections. As a tool to enable that activity, it may not be necessary to explicitly mention persistent identifiers as part of that remit.<\/p>  <p>The Natural History Museum's collection management system, EMu, creates GUIDs when records are saved. These are used to create links in the data portal to digitised collection items. The GUIDs are made up of an alphanumeric string. The NHM commits to maintain these links, although there is no policy or contractual commitment to do so. You can read more about this in the [case study report|https:\/\/doi.org\/10.22020\/k99s-we61].<\/p>  <p>The RBGE was involved in the development of CETAF Stable Identifiers which require the organisation to guarantee the persistence of the links. There is no policy requirement and in the development of the identifiers the organisations involved took the view that the organisations creating the identifiers were generally long-lasting heritage organisations and therefore guarantee persistence. You can read more about this in the case study report [LINK WHEN AVAILABLE].<\/p>  <h3>Policy<\/h3>  <p>A persistence policy for identifiers creates a publicly visible and explicit organisational commitment to persistence and helps to raise the awareness of that commitment throughout the organisation. A policy also allows for governance and responsibilities to be set out to underwrite persistence, helping to ensure persistence beyond the lifetime of any one service or platform used by the organisation.<\/p>  <p>Any type of persistent identifier can be said to support persistence, with the appropriate governance that can publicly reassure users of that commitment, e.g. URIs, ARKs, PURLs.<\/p>  <p>The British Library assigns ARK identifiers to its collection content but, to make sure it and the other identifiers it uses remain accessible, and to guard against institutional memory loss that may come about due to staff changes, it is adopting a persistent identifier policy to govern its use of persistent identifiers. The purpose of the Library\u2019s policy is to ensure continued good practice as well as increasing the assignment of identifiers across entities in the Library's collections. It also defines the Library's approach to their management and use of identifiers both new and existing.<\/p>  <p>The policy is in draft form and will be publicly available by late 2021. It is informed by the PID policy recently published by the Bibliotheque Nationale de France [https:\/\/www.bnf.fr\/fr\/politique-identifiants-bnf]. More information about the British Library's use of identifiers is contained in the case study available here [https:\/\/doi.org\/10.23636\/1242].<\/p>  <h3>PID services to guarantee persistence<\/h3>  <p>PIDs such as DOIs have global governance in place that underwrites persistence. For example, in order to mint DOIs you are contractually obliged to keep them resolvable, even if only to a \u2018tombstone\u2019 page when the resource is no longer available. The community of DOI users are also able to transfer ownership, so that the persistence of DOIs can be guaranteed beyond organisational lifetimes. It depends on the type of organisation and the type of metadata you have for your collection whether or not a particular PID service will be suitable for your organisation.<\/p>  <h3>Effort<\/h3>  <p>The effort of maintaining the persistence of identifiers is itself not high beyond keeping webpages accessible. Most effort will be concentrated on the development of any policy and associated governance, or setting up appropriate processes to ensuring contractual compliance if using systems like DOIs. More long term, effort needs to be factored in when planning for systems or content migrations to make sure that persistent links remain resolvable. <\/p><div class=\"alert alert-secondary\" role=\"alert\"><h4 class=\"alert-heading\">Feedback<\/h4><p>We value your feedback on this resource.

		"title": "<b>How to implement human readable PIDs?</b>",
		"parent": "Guidance",
		"content": "<p>By human readable PIDs, we mean that the information accessed via the identifier is readable, rather than the identifier itself. The main requirement for human readable PIDs is that each identifier takes users to a webpage that describes - and allows access to if possible - the item(s) to which the PID refers. This can be referred to as a \"landing page\". It is recommended that the identifier itself is \"opaque\", i.e. does not contain human-readable words that contain specific information, Because these PIDs need to be managed for the long term and should not be changed or deleted, including meaningful information that can change over time should be avoided.<\/p>  <p>They can be implemented using internally created URIs or identifiers generated from an external provider. The identifiers should be displayed on the page as links. Any PID including Handles, URIs, DOIs and ARKs can be implemented as human readable PIDs.<\/p>  <p>The British Library, Natural History Museum and RBGE case studies all describe different methods of implementing human readable PIDs. The British Library's repository implements human readable DOIs which are displayed with landing pages with access to the files.<\/p>  <p>The Natural History Museum has a similar use of DOIs for its research datasets on the data portal. The records for its specimens are available in a human readable format via the Data Portal, which is a specified 'data' domain within the NHM website. They are also available via an API for machine access, but one type of access does not require the other. In practice many organisations provide a human readable access and machine-readable access is developed later, but it can often be easier to develop both simultaneously as the Natural History Museum and National Gallery did.<\/p>  <h3>Effort<\/h3>  <p>Implementing human readable PIDs does not require much effort once you have web pages assigned to each item displaying either the item or metadata about it. The scale of the effort in creating those pages or how much of that work has already been done may inform decisions on the level at which you are able to assign identifiers. For example, whether you want to consider having a PID for each image will be a different conversation if you need to create metadata and webpages for three million images than for three thousand images.<\/p>   <p>There may be a cost associated with generating the identifiers if you are to use a charged third party service such as DOIs. Again, depending on the user options available to you, cost may determine how many you are able to create for schemes that charge on a scale relating to the number of PIDs you create.<\/p>  <div class=\"alert alert-secondary\" role=\"alert\"><h4 class=\"alert-heading\">Feedback<\/h4><p>We value your feedback on this resource.

		"content": "<p>By machine readable PIDs, we mean PIDs where the metadata about the resource to which the PID refers can be processed by a machine. To implement machine readable PIDs, items within the collection need to have information associated with them which can be processed or rendered in automated ways. This can be done by making metadata available in a machine readable format, e.g. JSON or RDF.<\/p>  <p>Any PID including Handles, URIs, DOIs and ARKs can be implemented as machine readable PIDs so long as the metadata is in a machine readable format.<\/p>  <p>The National Gallery's PID implementation includes both a human readable and machine readable aspect. When a machine requests a PID, the landing page metadata is returned with \u2018.json\u2019 at the end of the URL rather than .html or another webpage language. JSON is a machine readable format, if a human users wants to view a json version they can change the URL manually to see the JSON information. The data is taken from the collection management system and transformed by the CIIM middleware solution to a variety of formats.<\/p>  <p>The NHM expresses the metadata on its data portal in several formats including machine readable RDF and it is accessible via an API. Both of these applications were driven by integrating with linked open data collections and in the NHM's case integrating with the CETAF Stable Identifiers initiative. Both are described in more detail in their respective case studies. <\/p>  <h3>Effort<\/h3>  <p>Machine readable PIDs do not have to cost anything additional to human readable PIDs to implement. However all technology services require some maintenance, and therefore a SPARQL endpoint or an API may need to be updated and maintained periodically. It does not cost more to implement DOIs with content negotiation, but the content negotiation needs to be developed and maintained internally.<\/p><div class=\"alert alert-secondary\" role=\"alert\"><h4 class=\"alert-heading\">Feedback<\/h4><p>We value your feedback on this resource.

		"content": "<p>Prerequisite: Before you make PIDs which are globally resolvable you need to have a webpage for every item within your collection (see: [How to implement human-readable PIDs|https://tanc-ahrc.github.io/PIDResources/Implement%20human%20readable.html]).<\/p>\t<p>A globally resolvable PID is one where there is a single globally accessible domain that turns the identifier into a link, and that single domain will work for all PIDs of that given type, without knowing which organisation created it. For example \u2018https:\/\/doi.org\/\u2019 can be used to resolve any given DOI, no matter who created it. \u2018n2t.net\u2019 can resolve any ARK as long as it has been supplied and updated by the creator. Therefore PIDs that are globally resolvable are typically those with an internationally governed and supported community infrastructure. <\/p><p>By contrast, URIs require a user to know the full link including the domain including the country code in order to access the resources.<\/p><p>The National Gallery recently began assigning ARK identifiers to the paintings and entities within its collections. It took the identifiers assigned already assigned to its collection and made them resolve using the N2T resolver. Some of these resolvers have a paid for element. The DOI implementations at the BL and NHM describe globally resolvable PIDs which are made possible via paid for third party services. <\/p><h3>Effort<\/h3><p>Some globally resolvable PID services such as DOIs have a cost associated with creating them, either through membership or per identifier. Others such as the N2T resolver are free to use to make your ARK resolvable. Third party human readable PIDs from external service providers will give you globally resolvable PIDs by default. The human resource effort involved in implementing globally resolvable PIDs is typically less than enabling resolution for in-house PIDs, because the resolution infrastructure already exists and can be used right away. Building a resolution service for a local PID implementation will require development and hosting, which will then have to be managed in perpetuity to support persistence. This can be done with relatively little financial commitment, but organisational commitment is equally required for both local and global resolution.<\/p> <div class=\"alert alert-secondary\" role=\"alert\"><h4 class=\"alert-heading\">Feedback<\/h4><p>We value your feedback on this resource.

	"Cost of implementing identifiers": {
		"title": "<b>How much does it cost to implement PIDs?</b>",
		"parent": "Guidance",
		"content": "<p>For the purposes of this resource we have focused only on the cost of implementing identifiers, not on the substantial resource and effort required to make collections items available online, such as building a web presence for the collection, digitising it, or having it catalogued to a sufficient level where information about the catalogue can be put online.<\/p>\r\n<p>To add persistent identifiers for metadata into collection items, while there generally is not a cost to embedding identifiers within metadata, there will be a cost associated with the staff time of identifying, inputting and validating the identifiers. The schema of collection management systems may need to be updated as well as the fields and display of those identifiers on any website. This may require development time from an internal staff member or a supplier.<\/p>\r\n<p>Locally managed URIs such as CETAF Stable identifiers only require a dedicated data domain as best practice, which can be set up by a developer in a short amount of time. A machine readable version requires slightly more time, but it can be measured in days rather than weeks. Maintaining persistent identifiers has a cost, but only in so far as web pages need to be maintained. ARKs are also free to use.<\/p>\r\n<p>Utilising third party PID services can have a cost such as a subscription or membership cost to the provider that may or may not need to be supplemented with a cost per identifier created. This depends heavily on the cost of the service and service provider you decide to use. For example both [Crossref|https:\/\/www.crossref.org\/fees] and [DataCite|https:\/\/datacite.org\/feemodel.html] provide DOI services to organisations but operate on different costs bases. For example, in the UK, you can join the DataCite consortium administered by the British Library at a cost of approximately \u00A31,100 per year with a fee of \u20AC0.80 per DOI up to 1,999 DOIs and there is banded pricing for larger numbers of DOIs. Crossref have a tiered membership model based on annual revenue (e.g. $275 for revenue <$1 million) with an additional charge per DOI. Those services have different metadata requirements which will need to be considered but come with support such as monitoring for broken links and usage data.<\/p> \r\n<p>The Dutch Digital Heritage Network (DDHN) in the Netherlands ran a project from 2015 to develop persistent identifiers in heritage organisations. As a result of this project, 35 organisations implemented Handles within their collection management systems. They found that it was possible to implement PIDs via third party providers such as Handles via SURFSara with an ongoing cost of approximately \u20AC1,500 per institution per year. The first year included additional set up costs including set up of workflows and data preparation of an average \u20AC15,000, which were covered by the DDHN project.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Adding PIDs to metadata<\/h3>\r\n<p>If you need to create identifiers for metadata elements, e.g creators or collectors, this can be done using free or paid for services. The British Library's ISNI Quality team operate a paid model where you can request an ID to be created for \u00A35 via their [portal|https:\/\/isni.bl.uk\/?_ga=2.168370657.1545674640.1624524500-982658932.1614772159]. \r\nWikidata items can be created for individuals for free.
